                  <p> The current IT Tools that we are using have been extremely beneficial to the creation of the website. Trello being the first one, has helped in the process of creating a step by step plan of action to let me know where I am in all the phases of the website building.
                    Visual studio is perfect as it allows you to see how the coding works and 
                    Draw.io help create a structure of how the website will look.

        </div>
        <div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
          <p> The tools used were great and they were easy to understand and use. This meant that learning new techniques was simpler than expected. Visual studio code helped a lot as you could import other HTML codes and get a good grasp of how they were made and which areas affect what so it can be implemented in your own website.

          <p> The website that I have is good, with more time I could try and create it to the standard I would like and also to match the feel I was looking for. Having said that with just starting off i have been able to get the basic structure done so it would only require some minor adjustments. The changes I would make specifically would be to make the site look less static and more minimalistic. </p>

          <p> I could make the web pages responsive so it works on any device without having to code the changes on different screen sizes. Additionally, I would try and use blended colours to make the site pop slightly more. </p>

          <p> For a blog website to be effective it needs to have the text in a readable format and also the text needs to be structured correctly that way people know which areas they are in. I have included a navigation bar to go to the relevant pages. The padding has been made to make sure the site looks up to standard.  </p>
