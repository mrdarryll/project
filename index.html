        <p> The thing about technology is that it includes a wide range of choices to choose from, which means the key is finding the "right" solution for your problems. It's important to figure out which tech will help in the development of your business from those that will eventually end up being simply one more toy to use. 
          What can be done is picking technology that grows with the business, buying new technology is probably going to be costly, so considering what will need to be purchased is a must. Furthermore dissecting your business needs is important. Have an inventory of what technology is used now and how well it is serving the business then you can make an informed decision on next steps. Finally having a backup plan is important. Technology fails. It's an unavoidable truth. On the off chance that this was not anticipated, the possibility of the business closing down completely for a long period could occur. Doing this will assist you in gathering the data you should need in case of technological failures.

        <p>Trello has been a huge help in showing me how to plan the website and digital project process. Having a technology such as this makes the work that I do much more easier and streamlined. 
          A major advantage for using technologies such as trello is I can fully tailor it to suit my daily needs. For instance, I like to keep track of the tasks I do everyday, so I name different boards after different activities. This has helped me plan more effectively.
